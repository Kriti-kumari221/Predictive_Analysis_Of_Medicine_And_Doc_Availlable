## 📖 About The Project

The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning to address critical operational challenges in healthcare facilities. By predicting doctor availability and medicine stock levels, we can help hospitals and clinics to:
*   Proactively manage resources.
*   Optimize patient and staff scheduling.
*   Reduce wait times and prevent stockouts.
*   Ultimately, improve the quality of patient care.

This repository contains the source code, datasets, and models for this predictive analysis task.

##  Features

This project uses supervised machine learning to predict:

*    **Doctor Availability:** Forecasts when doctors are likely to be available or unavailable, helping to optimize appointment scheduling.
*    **Medicine Stock Levels:** Predicts potential shortages in essential medicines, allowing for timely reordering and inventory management.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system.
*   **Python (3.8+ recommended)**
    ```sh
    python --version
    ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ankushpahal-12/Predictive_Analysis_Of_Medicine_And_Doc_Availlable.git
    cd Predictive_Analysis_Of_Medicine_And_Doc_Availlable
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install Python packages**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

##  Usage

Use this section to show how to run your scripts or use your application.

1.  **To train the model:**
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```
2.  **To run predictions:**
    ```sh
    python predict.py --date 2023-10-27
    ```
<!-- TODO: Add more examples and explain the outputs. -->

##  Dataset

Describe the dataset(s) used for training and testing the models. Mention:
*   Source of the data (e.g., `Dataset Name`).
